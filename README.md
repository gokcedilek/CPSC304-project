## Welcome to our exciting project!

### Instructions on how to use the boilerplate:

The database (postgres) can be accessed here:
https://customer.elephantsql.com/instance

Username: abagshaw@alumni.ubc.ca

Password: cs304project

Right now there is only one table, *purchases* (this is actually the order table renamed). I also didn't include the part of the CREATE TABLE statement that makes columns into foreign keys because I don't want to go to the trouble of creating the other tables yet.

After you create an order, you can go and view in in the "BROWSER" tab in ElephantSQL. Then try:
```
select * from purchases;
```
